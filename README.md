# RingCipher
Small personal project for simplistic multi-layer (3) encryption/decryption algorithm implementation while also featuring variable-key encryption.

When passing a string to the Run() method either append '~' at its end for encryption or '`' for decryption.

Encryption/decryption complexity can be varied by adjusting Key1, Key2 or Alphabet variables.
